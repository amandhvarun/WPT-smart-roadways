# WPT-smart-roadways-for-EV's

## 🚗 Project Overview
This project focuses on the **design and implementation of a wireless power transfer (WPT) system** that enables continuous charging of **electric vehicles (EVs) while in motion**. By integrating WPT technology into **next-generation smart roads**, we aim to improve energy efficiency, reduce range anxiety, and eliminate the need for frequent charging stops.

## 🔥 Features
- **Dynamic Wireless Charging**: Power is transferred wirelessly using road-embedded transmitter coils.
- **Arduino-Based Control System**: Manages power transfer, vehicle detection, and safety mechanisms.
- **Smart Infrastructure**: Enhances EV range and user convenience with an adaptive charging system.
- **Energy-Efficient Technology**: Supports future enhancements like **solar-powered roads, IoT-based monitoring**, and **predictive maintenance**.

## 🛠 Hardware Components
- **Transmitting Coils** (Embedded in smart roads)
- **Receiver Coil** (Mounted on EV)
- **Arduino Microcontroller**
- **IR Sensors** (For vehicle detection)
- **Relay Circuit**
- **Energy Storage Battery**
- **Motorized Model Vehicle** (For simulation)

## 💻 Software & Development
- **Programming Language**: Embedded C
- **IDE**: Arduino IDE
- **Control Mechanism**: Real-time power management using microcontroller-based logic
